## Overview

Spot a Scholar is an application that allows users to list courses that they have taken and are willing to tutor in and courses that they feel like they need to be tutored in. This allows for people to both teach and learn from each other. Users must provide a photo so that other users can identify them.

There will be a section that will list ICS courses, and within this course, the users can see both the tutors and the ones who need tutoring. Users can then contact each other through the app to set up a time and place to meet within ICSpace. There will be an online calendar to show the meetings and who is attending.

Spot a scholar can be used to schedule a study session, or to find a tutor who is available to help with the problem you are having at the current moment.

## Goals

Since there is a barrier in getting students to ask for help, there can be some sort of reward system to be implemented in the future. What this exactly entails is still up for discussion.
